# Smart Procurement – Notes

This repository holds **all non-code documentation** for the Smart Procurement project.
It is the team’s **single source of truth** for decisions, plans, and references.

## Contents

* **MoMs** – decisions, action items, follow-ups
* **Plans** – roadmaps, milestones, strategy
* **Designs** – diagrams, images, architecture
* **References** – PDFs, docs, supporting files
* **Long-term notes** – anything worth remembering

## Why this exists

* Preserve decisions and context
* Prevent knowledge loss
* Make onboarding easy
* Keep planning separate from code

## Conventions

* Clear folder names (`mom/`, `plans/`, `design/`)
* MoMs named `YYYY-MM-DD.md`
* Update files instead of overwriting
* No production code

## Final note

If it explains **why** something exists, it belongs here.
If it explains **how** it runs, it belongs in the code repo.
